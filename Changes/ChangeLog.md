## Welcome to Realms Tutorial Collections Changelog

This section is provided According to [Changelog Setup][Tut ChangeLog] tutorial (V 1.0) and is used to provide users and staff to know whats going on as far as changes to the project on all levels of build.

### V P 0.0.1.0 Realms OOP Convert

This update was focused on starting over with only one active programming language while still working to provide all the previous same content although this will take time as our staff is small so our goal is to work to make things easier to pick up and continue where we left off plus being able to get users our content much smoother.
