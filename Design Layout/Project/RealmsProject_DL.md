### Design Layout Details

This Design Layout conforms to [Design Layout Docu][DL Docu DL] Design Layout (V 1.0).

Realms Project Design Layout is designed to outline what a project is and how we use them to help us in the process of development.

- Details
	- Layout Category: Projects
	- Version: V 1.0
	- Owner Project: E.AMT.Learn.Tutorial.Main
	

### Required Knowledge and Tools

- Requirements
	- Knowledge
		- (American) English
	- Tools
		- None

### What Is a Realms Project

A Realms Project is a concept we use to organize and develop our own projects. They are designed to be a highly organized while flexable layout of what a project is to help make projects easier to work on and manage.

They are also designed to promote indepth thinking about how things work together by breaking down functionality or goals down into [Logic Systems][DL Proj System]. Systems themselves are broken down into [System Features][DL Proj Feat] to further organize and build a project.

### Why our own Project Setup

Our long term as a compnay is to build our own operating system to be used as the offical company operating system. Our goal with Realms Projects is to make it easier for users to support our operating system with thier own works.

Our Project Setup is a complete refresh to have a solid foundation for the development of our projects. So we can build our projects with the concept of [Continual Development][DL Design Continual] with a complete set of projects that which have minimal external third party dependancies to limit our issues to projects we control and maintain.

Our hope is this will make our projects as stable and bug free as possible.

Ontop of the above we hope it will promote people into breaking things up with the goal of reuse as much as possible. Further expanding the capabilities to be as limitless as possible while also being flexable enough for smaller to bigger tasks as possible.

### Realms Project Defined

Alright, so you want to make a Realms Project. Is there anything you must do first? The answer to that is yes, well sort of. If you are already a [Realms User][DL User] then you will already know your UserID. If not you will need to register an account with us.

Now that we have our Realms User ID, we will want to think of the category(ies) you wish your project for your given project. We will be compressing the categories down into [Camel Case Naming][DL Design CamelCase] to be used into a ProjectID [Namespace][DL Design Namespace]. This will allow other projects to reference the given project. For the our Official Categories please check [AMT Project Categories][DL Proj Categories] or [User Third Party Categories][DL 3RDParty User Categories] to define your own categories for your projects.

For example the ProjectID for this collection is **E.AMT.Learn.Tutorial.Main**. To walk you through this ID, first come the Company User ID (E at the start shows a registered [Realms Entity User][DL User Entity]), followed by our User Shortcode **AMT**. For a normal user your UserID should start with a **U**, Entities are companies register with us.

Next you will need to choose what will be your [Project ID Piece][DL Design IDPieces]. This string again uses Camel Case Naming but is only a short ID, normally we recomend using the last ID of the ProjectID, however this is not required. For example we use TutHome as the ProjectID Piece for this Project, as this project is what we Call A Primary Category project.

Next you will want to think of a starting [Project Version][DL Design Versions] that will be the starting point of your project. For AMT we start at the development level and start at V D 0.0.1.0. This is to reflect that our projects have not been released yet.

The last pieces you will want to think about is short description that descripts the project along with if only select users can access/view or if you want it to be available to everyone in each case you will use Private or Public. Please note that this access is not "Edit Access" as this will work around [User Teamwork][DL User Teamwork] system.

So after this you should have the following infomation planned out (Data in JSON format with info in the data is that of this Project).

```json
{
	"ProjectID" : "E.AMT.Learn.Tutorial.Main",
	"ProjectIDPiece": "TutHome",
	"StartingVersion": "V D 0.0.1.0",
	"ShortDesc": "This Project is designed to project the project subcategory [Tutorial] of the [Learn] category to make our projects much cleaner and easier to understand and use",
	"AccessLevel":"Public"
}
```

### Whats Next

First you should celebrate, you have made your first project. After that you will want to check out [Logic System Design][DL Design System] and think out the makeup you will want your project to be made up of.
