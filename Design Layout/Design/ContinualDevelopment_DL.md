### What is Stepped Continual Development

Stepped Continual Development is the process of using deep versioning Alining to [Realms Projects][DL Proj Proj] along with our custom [Versioning][DL Design Versions] to version projects, Systems, features and also objects that are designed to be loaded. 

We do this because one of our main goals is Minimalized backwords compatibility. Why, we bet you are asking yourself. This is because our projects are designed to continual development. all our projects will be designed with expansion in mind. While some may be marked as complete they will always recieve fixes to ensure our projects are Clean and minimal bloat that comes from back compatibility.

While yes you might think that will hinder our projects. We provide [Tutorial Collection Wikis][DL Proj TutCollect] to provide a way to know about changes but also learn the systems that make up each project. We do so to provide our [Realms Users][DL User User] with the power to keep up.

### Deeper Focus

Oh you thought we where done with its uses. we provide the data and tracking to help both our staff and users understand the functionality of our projects and direct understanding In both technical but also easy to follow tutorials and even Design Layouts.

Since we build our projects to power other projects or to expand on our own projects making everything easier to use and understand will help our users with bug reports and also understanding why we develop the way we do.

### Planned Expanded Useages

Much of the uses of Stepped Continual Development is to allow us to build our own project development kit which will provide automation capabilities to the design process to ensure that development of projects is as smooth and organized as possible while ensureing given projects are also documented and managed.

### Whats Next

Your next step would be to get familuar with out [Versioning][DL Design Versions] as well as our [Changes][DL Proj Changes] to get familuar with how projects are versioned and changes to versions handled.
