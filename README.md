### Welcome to Realms Tutorial Collections

Welcome to AMT's [Realms Tutorial Collection][Page DesignLayout TutCollect] project [Realms Tutorial Collections][Page Project Home] designed to provide a clean and easy to understand format for designing and maintaining documenation for all our projects.

Our Goal with Realms Tutorial Collections is to provide users, volunteer staff and staff alike with clear and easy to understand details around each project.

Our long term hope is that as we grow people will continue to develop thier own products to register to be place on a planned project we have of Realms Shop which will allow users to spend [Realms Contribution Points][Page DesignLayout RCP] which can be purchased or earned through our [Contribution Rewards System][Page DesignLayout ContributeRewards].

For a more in-depth view of Realms Tutorial Collections Project please check the [Project][Page Project Home] for more details.
